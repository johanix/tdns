# DOG

**DOG** is a trivial implementation of a DNS query tool, similar to the
much more capable utility "*dig*" (from the BIND distribution). DOG has
support for the new record types (i.e. DSYNC and DELEG) that TDNS-SERVER
implements.

The CLI interface to **DOG** is as close to identical to *dig* as possible.
