   # Database configuration
   # Type: "sqlite" or "mariadb"
   # For SQLite: dsn is the file path (e.g., "/var/lib/tdns/kdc.db")
   #   Example: type: sqlite
   #            dsn: "/var/lib/tdns/kdc.db"
   # For MariaDB: dsn is "user:password@tcp(host:port)/dbname"
   #   Example: type: mariadb
   #            dsn: "kdcuser:password@tcp(localhost:3306)/tdns_kdc"

   # Control zone where KMCTRL records are published
   # This zone must be served by the KDC and will contain control records
   # for edge nodes to discover the KDC and request keys
   control_zone:        "kdc.example.com."
   
   # Default DNSSEC algorithm for generated keys
   # Common values: 15 (ED25519), 13 (ECDSAP256SHA256), 8 (RSASHA256)
   default_algorithm:    15   # ED25519
   
   # How often to rotate ZSKs (Zone Signing Keys)
   # Format: Go duration (e.g., "720h" = 30 days, "168h" = 7 days)
   key_rotation_interval: 720h   # 30 days
   
   # Number of standby ZSKs to maintain for rapid rollover
   # When a key is compromised, a standby key can be activated immediately
   standby_key_count:    2
   
   # Key state transition timing configuration:
   
   # publish_time: Time a key must remain in 'published' state before automatically
   # transitioning to 'standby'. This allows old cached DNSKEY RRsets to expire
   # and ensures the key is widely available before it becomes available for distribution.
   # Format: Go duration string (e.g., "24h" = 24 hours, "168h" = 7 days, "48h" = 2 days)
   # The KeyStateWorker background process checks every minute and transitions keys
   # that have been published for at least this duration.
   publish_time:         24h   # 24 hours
   
   # retire_time: Time a key must remain in 'retired' state before automatically
   # transitioning to 'removed'. This allows all RRSIGs signed by the retired key
   # to expire, ensuring the key is no longer needed in the DNSKEY RRset.
   # Format: Go duration string (e.g., "30d" = 30 days, "720h" = 30 days, "14d" = 14 days)
   # The KeyStateWorker background process checks every minute and transitions keys
   # that have been retired for at least this duration.
   retire_time:          30d   # 30 days
   
   # distribution_ttl: Time-to-live for key distributions (replay protection)
   # Distributions include a timestamp in the JSONMANIFEST metadata, and KRS validates
   # that distributions are not older than this TTL. This prevents replay attacks where
   # an old distribution is reused. The timestamp is protected by DNSSEC (RRSIG on
   # JSONMANIFEST), providing integrity protection.
   # Format: Go duration string (e.g., "5m" = 5 minutes, "10m" = 10 minutes)
   # Default: 5 minutes (same as TSIG signatures). Set to 0 to disable TTL validation.
   distribution_ttl:     5m    # 5 minutes (default, like TSIG)
   
   # jsonchunk_max_size: Maximum RDATA size per JSONCHUNK record in bytes
   # This controls how large each chunk can be when distributing encrypted keys
   # via the JSONCHUNK RRtype. Larger values mean fewer chunks but larger DNS messages.
   # Default: 60000 (60KB). Maximum practical size is ~64KB due to DNS message limits.
   # For testing with small chunk sizes, set this to a smaller value (e.g., 1000).
   jsonchunk_max_size:   60000   # 60KB (default)
